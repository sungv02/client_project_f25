      <h2>How to Leave a Lasting Impression and Build a Network</h2>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>Who Is In Your Network?</strong> You may already have connections. Start by writing a list of individuals who are already in your network along with their job title and employer name.</li>
         <li><strong>Reflect</strong> Based on your current connections, group individuals based on the job sectors and fields they work in, such as Technology, Education, or Government.</li>
         <li><strong>Strategize</strong> Develop a plan of action for how to build your network. Who is missing from your current network? Who can you contact to expand your current network? Write down potential contacts and identify ways to build more connections.</li>
         <li><strong>Practice</strong> Tailor your introduction and bio. Practice introducing yourself to others, create your career story, and prepare some follow-up questions.</li>
         <li><strong>Reach Out</strong> Attend career fairs, go to professional development events, and start connecting with others.</li>
